# Gatsby + Typescript Website Template

This is a slightly more developed version of the default Gatsby TS starter. It includes:
- A few common web pages
- A basic layout component with a header and footer
- The Gatsby SASS plugin and empty stylesheet
- The Gatsby MDX plugin with empty MDX files imported into each page

To use this template:

1. First clone this repo.
2. In your shell, navigate into the website directory, install gatsby, then run the local server:
    ```shell
    cd gatsby-ts-starter
    npm install gatsby
    npm run develop
    ```
3. In your browser, go to http://localhost:8000 to view the website live.
